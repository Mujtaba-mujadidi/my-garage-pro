# MyGaragePro — Build Progress Tracker

Companion to [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md). **Delivery model:** gated phases — build → deploy staging → **you test → sign off** → next module (see PROJECT_PLAN §25).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-02  
**Current phase:** **PCO module UAT** (workflow redesign on feature branch)  
**Current gate:** ⏳ PCO bookings — local UAT on `feat/pco-booking-workflow`  
**UAT note:** Phases 1–3 signed off on **local** (`pnpm dev`); Railway staging deferred.  
**Latest on `main`:** `4cefc29` — PCO module (initial).  
**Active branch:** `feat/pco-booking-workflow` @ `a795f72` (+ uncommitted refinements — reschedule, notes, priority, edit, slot payments).  
**Resume next session:** Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), then [PCO_MODULE.md](./PCO_MODULE.md) for full handoff, then **Decision log** and **PCO module** below.

**Staging URL:** _Railway → **web** service → Settings → Networking → **Public domain**_ (verify in dashboard; stale docs URLs cause 404)

**Local dev:** [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) · **Railway deploy:** [RAILWAY_AUTODEPLOY.md](./RAILWAY_AUTODEPLOY.md)

## Status legend

- `[ ]` Not started
- `[~]` In progress
- `[x]` Done
- **Gate:** `⏳` awaiting your test · `✅` signed off · `❌` failed (fix & re-test)

---

## How you sign off a gate

1. Open **staging URL** when the phase is marked ready for test.
2. Follow the **Test script** for that phase below (or `docs/UAT_TEST_CASES.csv`).
3. Log bugs in GitHub Issues (tag with phase number, e.g. `phase-3`).
4. Tell the dev: **Pass** (next phase can start) or **Fail** (list blockers).
5. Dev updates **Gate** column below to ✅ only after your Pass.

**Regression (every gate):** Before signing a new gate, spend ~5 min on the **Smoke checklist** at the bottom.

## Railway: does `git push main` apply everything?

**Short answer:** Yes, **if** each Railway service is connected to GitHub `main` with **auto deploy** on — but only for services whose **watch paths** include the files you changed. This repo uses `apps/api/railway.toml` and `apps/web/railway.toml` for that.

| What | Automatic on push to `main`? | Notes |
|------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Web build & deploy** | Yes (web service) | Rebuilds when `apps/web/**`, `packages/shared/**`, or lockfile changes |
| **API build & deploy** | Yes (api service) | Rebuilds when `apps/api/**`, `packages/shared/**`, or lockfile changes |
| **DB migrations** | Yes (API **start** command) | `prisma migrate deploy` runs on every API container start — see `apps/api/railway.toml` |
| **Seed data** | **No** | `prisma db seed` is **not** run on Railway; run manually if needed |
| **Docs-only push** | **Skipped** | Watch paths exclude `docs/**` — use **Deployments → Deploy** to force |

**After this push, staging should pick up:**

- Migration `20260602101701_suppliers` (and any earlier not yet applied)
- Customers + suppliers API/UI (incl. supplier detail, credit, purchases)
- Shared **Record payment** modal (invoices + customer profile)
- Supplier part-order `supplierId` fix; broader purchase history query
- Tyre add/receive stock purchase UX (cost/VAT/payment)
- Super Admin garage edit (tabs, sticky save bar)
- Settings tabs (General + Roles & access)
- Team delete, disable/enable confirmations
- Dynamic permissions per enabled module

**Verify after deploy:** API logs show `migrate deploy` success; web build SHA on staging matches latest commit.

## Architecture & hosting (planned — not built yet)

Decisions from 2026-06-12 planning (VAT receipts, mobile, go-live). **Use this section to resume work** without relying on chat history. For **PCO bookings**, see [PCO_MODULE.md](./PCO_MODULE.md).

### Production stack (target)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Web + API | **Railway** | Current staging/prod path; keep for go-live |
| Database | **Railway Postgres** | Metadata + tenancy (`garageAccountId`); easy to migrate later via `DATABASE_URL` |
| File blobs | **Object storage** (R2 or Supabase Storage) | Receipts/photos; not Postgres BYTEA |
| Queue / workers | **Redis on Railway** | Notifications, PDF jobs (when added) |
| Mobile | **Same API + same DB** | No direct DB access from app; JWT + RBAC |

**Do not** move main app DB to Supabase Postgres for multi-garage — Railway Postgres + Prisma is sufficient.

### VAT receipt / scan upload (backlog)

**Goal:** Attach supplier receipt PDFs to **ledger expenses** (external invoices) for VAT submission.

| Item | Plan |
|------|------|
| v1 scope | Ledger expense entries (+ stock purchases that post ledger) |
| Metadata | `DocumentAttachment` in Postgres (`ledgerEntryId`, `storageKey`, size, `uploadedBy`) |
| Files | Private bucket or Railway Volume for MVP; `StorageService` abstraction to swap R2/Supabase later |
| Web | Upload PDF |
| Mobile / iPad | Camera scan → compress images → merge to small PDF |
| Cost (1 garage, Railway Volume) | ~£0–1/mo for scan storage at current volume |

**Not started** — waiting on hosting confirmation for blob provider.

### Push notifications (backlog)

| Item | Plan |
|------|------|
| In-garage alerts | FCM (iOS/Android) + Web Push (PWA); **not** Supabase Realtime |
| Data | `notifications` + `device_tokens` tables in Postgres |
| Mobile v1 | PWA first; Capacitor/Expo shell if iOS push needs native |

### Tyre inventory UX (design only)

- Separate SKU row per supplier line (same size OK).
- Job picker: `{size} — {brand} · {supplier} · {qty}`; **0 qty disabled**.

---

## Backlog / next build (priority order)

1. **PCO module UAT** — commit uncommitted workflow refinements on `feat/pco-booking-workflow`, test locally, merge to `main`. Handoff: [PCO_MODULE.md](./PCO_MODULE.md).
2. **Phases 4–8 local UAT** sign-off (ledger, invoices, repair, parts, tyres, bodywork).
3. **Tyre job picker** — supplier + stock on repair jobs (Phase 9 with PWA).
4. **Receipt upload Phase 1** — `DocumentAttachment` + API + ledger UI (Phase 14).
5. **Notification tables + Web Push** (pre go-live).
6. **MTD VAT export** incl. receipt links (later).

---

## PCO module — signed-off spec

**Status:** `[x]` Built (initial on `main`) · `[~]` Workflow redesign on `feat/pco-booking-workflow`  
**Gate:** ⏳ UAT  
**Full handoff:** [PCO_MODULE.md](./PCO_MODULE.md) (workflow, API, migrations, UAT script)  
**Shared types:** `packages/shared/src/pco-types.ts`

### Workflow summary

Two-step: **Add request** → **To book** (`PENDING`) → **Add booking details** → **Active** (`ACTIVE`) → **Complete** → **Past**. **Reschedule** on active moves back to To book. Due-to-renew / V5C tabs use a **28-day** window and hide vehicles with open bookings.

### Job types

`Renewal` · `New` · `Admin` · `Logbook expiring` · `Retest` · **`Reschedule`**

### Key fields

**Vehicle:** VRM, keeper, address, contact, first registration, PCO/V5C expiry, optional make/model/colour/fuel/seats, vehicle note.

**Booking:** Job type, priority (High/Medium/Low), charge (default **£140**, no VAT), notes, centre/date/time when scheduled, **slot payment method**, **client informed / confirmed** (Active bookings only, after appointment is booked).

### Tabs (UI)

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Active bookings | `ACTIVE` |
| To book | `PENDING` — priority sorted high first |
| Past bookings | `COMPLETED` |
| V5C expiring | Logbook due within 28d |
| Due to renew (28d) | PCO expiry within 28d |
| Centres | Booking centre settings |

### Finance

- No invoice PDF; partial payments on booking → ledger income `source_module = PCO`
- Complete: next PCO expiry = **previous expiry + 1 year**

### Build checklist

- [x] Prisma: `PcoVehicle`, `PcoBooking`, `PcoBookingPayment`; `LedgerSourceModule.PCO`
- [x] API: CRUD, schedule, return-to-book, complete, due lists, VRM lookup, centres
- [x] Web: `/pco` — tabs, two-step flow, ⋮ row actions, edit, notes, slot payment on schedule
- [x] Migrations through `20260617140200_pco_slot_payment_enum` (see PCO_MODULE.md)
- [x] Seed demo centre; `pco.read` / `pco.write` on Manager/Staff
- [ ] Commit latest refinements on feature branch
- [ ] **You:** UAT ([test script in PCO_MODULE.md](./PCO_MODULE.md#uat-test-script))
- [ ] Merge `feat/pco-booking-workflow` → `main`

---

## Phase 15 — Go-live

**Test script**
1. Import founding-garage data (or agreed subset).
2. Production deploy; smoke test with owner.
3. Real users trained; support process agreed.

**Gate:** ⏳ **Signed off:** _

---

## Regression smoke (run before every new gate sign-off)

- [ ] Login / logout works
- [ ] Sidebar + dark mode OK
- [ ] Previous module’s core flow still works (see last signed-off phase)
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leak (if multi-garage on staging)

---
